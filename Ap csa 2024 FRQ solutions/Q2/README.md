2024 FRQ #2

This question is about updadting the score of two teams playing aganst each other. The teams alternate turns so when one is active the other is not. When a team get 0 their turn end and its the other teams turn now. Else the score will be added to the current active team.

Struggles with this question are how to make one team active and the other not.

Prior expereiences that helped the differnt method that could help me in doing the active inactive team.

What I learned by doing this question are that I can use munbers odd and even to make which team is active.
